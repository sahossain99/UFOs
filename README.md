# UFOs

## Overview of the Project 
The purpose of the project was to help a journalist Dana to create a HTML page to display an article regarding UFO sightings and a dynamic table with all UFO sighting information that reacts based on the search criteria's entered by the user. For this project there was data stored regarding UFO sightings in a JavaScript array. In an HTML page this table of UFO sightings was rendered as a fully dynamic table. Allowing the user to the filter the data in the table with search criteria's such as: 
- Date 
- City 
- State 
- Country 
- Shape

The table reacts to user input based on the filtered criteria and also displays Dana's article providing an excellent visualization for any user interested in UFO sightings.
